# AngularBasic2021

My refresher on Angular for a code challenge. I worked extensively with Angular for my first agile experience, as well as two internships and 
various side projects. That has been too long ago. I would love to work with Angular again, but I need to get my bearings back because I have 
been focusing solely on React for the most part in the last year.

## Running Locally and About Angular
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1.
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Documentation

I have moved the stock Angular README to `~/Documentation`. I may add other docs there later.

## Contributing

This only concerns me but I put this here in principle anyways because I like to act like I am working on a professiona project even on personal 
projects.

### Basics

* Move code that is fairly stable but needs review and testing to the `development` branch
* Place all issues in some GitHub project
* Tag commits with issue numbers and the project, like `Addresses #X (Title of Commit)` and `Project: 'Project Title'`
